<Summary>Java packages for transferring data between
XML documents and relational databases</Summary>

<Description>

<Para>XML-DBMS is a set of Java packages for transferring data between XML documents and relational databases. It views the XML document as a tree of objects in which element types are generally viewed as classes and attributes and PCDATA as properties of those classes. It then uses an object-relational mapping to map these objects to the database. An XML-based mapping language is used to define the view and map it to the database.</Para>
